# Demo Walkthrough

In this simplified demo we simulated three actors who are participating in the supply chain of research information used to counter COVID-19 pandemics. The objective of it is to showcase the case towards setting up a decentralized platform to submit, track and query research data.

## Perspective of a research author

From the perspective of research author, our application showcases the process of submitting a research or medical data that is supplied with a (i) digital timestamp of the data regardless of its binary and presentation form supplied with (ii) cryptographic proof of document content, (iii) a unique identifier of a content submitter.

## Perspective of a peer reviewer

From the perspective of peer reviewer, our application showcases the process of commenting a research or medical data that is supplied from a uniquely identifiable research author. Any subsequent modificaiton of an existing entry is supplied with a (i) digital timestamp of the data regardless of its binary and presentation form supplied with (ii) cryptographic proof of document content, (iii) a unique identifier of a content submitter. Moreover, this element of the process shows the capability to (iv) register subsequent activities that can be tracked to a uniquely identifiable piece of research.

## Perspective of a Regulator

From the perspective of regulator, our application showcases the process of approving a research or medical data that is supplied from a uniquely identifiable research author and is updated by a number of peer reviewers. Again, any interaction with the entry is registered with a (i) digital timestamp of the data regardless of its binary and presentation form supplied with (ii) cryptographic proof of document content, (iii) a unique identifier of a content submitter. Continuously, the entry is tracing back any activities related to a uniquely identifiable piece of research supplied by equally uniquely identifiable author.
