# One-sentence description

The platform for sharing lab research and medical data to accelerate work on vaccine and improve knowledge on COVID-19.

# The problem your product solves

In the context of COVID-19 pandemics, the time to delivery of essential data to apply countermeasures and design a vaccine is of outmost importance. However, at current pace of pandemics spread, a reliable research and medical data is broadcasted to the general public too slow. This is due to three reasons:

a) The slowness in publishing research work is caused by redundant administrative tasks unrelated to the research effort, such as securing intellectual property recognition, using qualified digital signatures and selecting information hubs of high reputation from data security perspective. 

b) Traditionally, authentication, timestamping and reputation are provided by central authorities or recognized bodies. However, these are now overrun by emergency tasks and are further impacted by a reduction of available staff to support the ongoing activities. A weak level of digitization traditionally required an in-person interaction. 

c) Proliferation of copies of the same data generates redundant activities across small community pockets unrelated or unaware of each other. Subsequent research linked to a particular copy will gather a limited recognition and cause a duplication of work based on the same document which is burning scarce time and resources.

# The solution that you bring to the table / Objective Results

For the purpose of this hackathon, our platform is just a showcase of functionalities that allow for a submission of research data and tracking of subsequent activities related to its lifecycle (feedback, updates, curation, comments, references). By the end of this weekend we intend to deliver the following result:

a) From the user perspective, our application will allow every submission and subsequent interaction of a research or medical data is supplied with a (i) digital timestamp of the data regardless of its binary and presentation form supplied with (ii) cryptographic proof of document content, (iii) a unique identifier of a content submitter and (iv) capability to register subsequent activities that can be tracked to a uniquely identifiable piece of research.

b) From the service provider perspective, we build our solution on the backend that is based on Hyperledger Fabric, an open-source blockchain platform supplied with smart contracts capability. This is going allow for avoidance of overreliance in central gateways that may fail at any point. Blockchain will address the need for data immutability, timestamp and tracking capabilities.

# What you have done during the weekend

Our efforts are based on both (a) infrastructure deployment and use case design at a presentation layer and (b) refining the business case for presentation purposes. It is a mix of technical and business activities executed by all team members. 
We will provide (a) technical components, (b) deployment instructions and (c) user stories to allow for deployment and use of utility networks with built-in functionalities for purposes described above. We will also provide a demo environment for the use by the general public to receive necessary feedback.

# The solution’s impact on the crisis / Scale of impact

As a result, a quickly deployed network of nodes can act as trustless gateways for document and research content submissions that can be cross-verified for timestamp, document integrity and supplied identity across the entire network. This will radically shorten the amount of time needed to (a) verify the origin of the document and thus, IPR ownership (b) access a tamper-proof copy of a document from anywhere in the world (c) track all activities related to a uniquelly identifiable research material across its lifecycle.
